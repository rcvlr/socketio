# socket.io and simple-peer
First experiments with [socket.io](https://socket.io) and [simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer). This simple chat application uses simple-peer library to connect two peers, the signaling is implemented with socket.io.

Inspired by socket.io [getting started](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/), this NODESOURCE [article](https://nodesource.com/blog/understanding-socketio/), and simple-peer usage [example](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer).
